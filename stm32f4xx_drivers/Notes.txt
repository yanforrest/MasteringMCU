Notes  about MCU bus interface
==========================================================
if the instructions are present in between the memory locations os 0x00000000 t0 0x1FFFFFFC then
the Cortex Processor will fetch the instruction using ICODE interface

if the instructions are present outside of 0x00000000 t0 0x1FFFFFFC  then precessor fetches the instructions
over the system bus.

if the data is present in between  0x00000000 t0 0x1FFFFFFF  then precessor fetches the data 
over D-CODE bus interface

if the data is present outside of 0x00000000 t0 0x1FFFFFFF memory locations then, the data will be 
fetched over the system bus .
